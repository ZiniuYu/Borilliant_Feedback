NAME:  Ziniu Yu


COLLABORATORS AND OTHER RESOURCES:
List the names of everyone you talked to about this assignment
(classmates, TAs, ALAC tutors, upperclassmen, students/instructor via
LMS, etc.), and all of the resources (books, online reference
material, etc.) you consulted in completing this assignment.

Remember: Your implementation for this assignment must be done on your
own, as described in "Academic Integrity for Homework" handout.



ESTIMATE OF # OF HOURS SPENT ON THIS ASSIGNMENT:  12+ for the normal
	and 2+ for the extra



EXTRA CREDIT:
Describe your implementation changes to allow alternate structuring
elements (different size/shape).  Paste in sample command lines,
sample input & output and discuss the different results.

You can add one more argument to dilation, erosion and flood fill 
in command line called “large”, which will change the structuring
elements to a square instead of a plus sign.

For example:
	./image_processing.out input4.txt output4.txt dilation X large
	./image_processing.out input4.txt output4.txt erosion X \. large  	./image_processing.out input4.txt output4.txt floodfill 2 10 O large

And they will give the result:

.............
.XXXXX...XXX.
.XXXXX...XXX.
.XXXXX...XXX.
.XXXXX...XXX.
.XXXXXXXXX...	dilation large
.XXXXXXXXX...
.XXXXXXXXX...
.XXXXXXXXX...
.XXXXXXXXX...

.............
.............
..XXX.....0..
..XXX.....0..
..XXX........
..XXX........
..XXXXXXX.... floodfill large
..XXXXXXX....
..XXXXXXX....
.............
.............


As you can see, the last one seems not working, it is because there
are no two elements in diagonal direction. If we modify the input file
like this:

.............
.............
..XXX.....X..
..XXX.....X..
..XXX.....X..
..XXX....X... input(modified)
..XXXXXXX....
..XXXXXXX....
..XXXXXXX....
.............
.............

and the output is gonna like this:

.............
.............
..000.....0..
..000.....0..
..000.....0..
..000....0... floodfill large
..0000000....
..0000000....
..0000000....
.............
