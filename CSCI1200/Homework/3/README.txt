MISC. COMMENTS TO GRADER:  
Optional, please be concise!

	I apologize for the super long output for my own test cases
	because of the use of random function. And there are some
	more I want to say in the very ending of my output.

	To be honest, my random tetris test case reveals lots of
	bugs which I havenâ€™t thought of, and those bugs will probably
	produce lots of memory errors.
