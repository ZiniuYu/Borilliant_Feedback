Who should enroll: Students who are interested in how data policies are made and evaluated; anyone who will be working in the data analytics, informatics, or other data-related field; anyone who likes to critique an argument, or who wants to learn how; anyone who has wondered what happens to all of that collected data; anyone who wants to understand the broader connections inherent in policy formulation. You will work in teams to analyze and evaluate specific aspects of current data policies, and present your analysis to the class.",

First, it examines the role of data at the operational, tactical, and strategic levels of the organization. Second, it provides students with knowledge and hands on training of technologies that manipulate data, including  structured query language (SQL), extraction transformation and loading tools (ETL), data warehousing (DW), online analytical processing (OLAP), and data mining (DM). The course exposes students to big data management techniques. Finally, the course provides students the theory and hands on training to understand the transformation of data to information.\n When Offered: Fall term annually.Credit Hours: 3",
